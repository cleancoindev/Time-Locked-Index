# Time-Locked-Index
The TLI is a measure to quantify the harmonicity of noisy time series.

# Description
Besides the TLI function (/v0/function_TimeLockedIndex), you will find a main test script (/v0/test_TLI) and all the auxiliary functions required to compute the TLI for the dynamics of the Van der Pol oscillator.
